## What certifications should I get?

It depends on what you are interested in, or roles you think you want to shoot for. common certification 'stack' recommended on r/cybersecurity is A+, Net+, and Sec+. This is a great recommendation for getting started in IT and who want to build towards many common cybersecurity careers.

This is a complex answer because different regions have different regulations and different standards which may require or prefer different certifications, for example CompTIA Security+ is valid but not well known in Australia. The list of certifications below is mostly generic and widely accepted but do your own research in your region before deciding pursue a specific cert.

### CompTIA

CompTIA has very good entry level certs and some intermediary that can be valuable to someone transitioning from another IT area or even completely outside of technology industry. Certifications from CompTIA are vendor neutral so the core concepts apply everywhere regardless of vendor or technology used.

**A+:** Entry level for someone without any knowledge or experience on IT in general, this certification is focused in basic hardware and software notions, troubleshooting basic issues in operating systems and other support tasks. There is no mandatory order for CompTIA certs, all certifications can be taken independently but there is a path to grow from cert to cert.

**Network+:** Probably the next logical step after A+, this certification is focused in understand the basic concepts of computer networks, design and troubleshoot those networks and understand all the technologies involved in that.

**Security+:** The first actual security focused certification. This one will present most fields of Cyber Security and Information Security, main concepts and technologies and give a good knowledge bases for entry level positions in cyber security.

**CySa+:** The certification following Sec+ on the hands-on cybersecurity side. Intended for people looking to advance on this more hands-on technical side like incident responders, threat detection, etc.

**CASP+:** The highest level of CompTIA certifications in security. Expanding the previous ones to architecture concepts, techniques and requirements and to other concepts related with more Infosec than technical hands-on.

CompTIA does have other certifications like Pentest+, Linux+, Cloud+ and others, however other providers have better equivalent certifications.

### ISC2

ISC2 is one of the main certification organisation holding the CyberSecurity holy grail called CISSP. Their certifications tend to be more on administrative level than technical hands-on but for that specific end those are very high regarded.

**SSCP:** The entry level certification, a bit of hands-on but focused on the main cybersecurity concepts, something similar to Security+.

**CCSP:** Considered by some a subset of CISSP focused on cloud security. Basic concepts of cloud and cybersecurity focused on the more administrative side but touching some vendor agnostic technical controls.

**CISSP:** Probably the mainly adopted and desired certification of the entire industry. CISSP is designed for management level but desired (and sometimes wrongly requested) in all levels of cybersecurity career.

### CSA

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has a very good certification focused on cloud security called **CCSK** similar to CCSP. This certification is an open book certification which means will be an easy test since you can consult your answers on the book.

### Offensive Security

OffSec is very high regarded for certifications that remembering definitions without knowing the practice will not help. Those certifications are not a simple multiple choice exam, most of them involve some sort of practice exam to test the candidates to the limit.

**OSCP:** One of the best certifications for penetration testers in the field and one of the most challenging certification to get. Extremely hands-on covering all bases for pentest. Following the same logic OffSec have other more specific certifications focused on pentest or specialisation.

**OSCE:** Same style of OSCP but focused on exploring flaws and writting exploits for web applications

**OSEE:** More focused on the exploitation side of things, writing modules for exploit frameworks, identifying flaws and creating exploit PoCs for them and all sorts of heavy coding for security.

### EC-Council

In the past provided ok certifications for entry level, nowadays most certs (except **CHFI** for forensics that still seems to be good) and the parent company have a very bad reputation having unethical behaviour despite calling their certification Ethical Hacking. The main certification called **CEH** teaches the candidates only how to run a bunch of scripts and tools without much knowledge of the overall security concepts and even the legality of their actions
