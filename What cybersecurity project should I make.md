## What cybersecurity project should I make?

Ok so like any other study guide first you need to identify what you would like to do, what area of cybersecurity you like most. Before adding recommendations here are some common misconceptions:
1. You don’t need to know pentest if you don’t like it. Most security folk start from there because it is probably the most attractive role in the area, who don’t want to be hacker that breaks into companies and get paid for that and have a “get out of jail free” card? But if it is not your thing don’t feel forced to learn. Notions of it is great though but focus on what is a direct prerequisite for where you want to go.
2. You don’t need to know it all. When you start is very easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of resources and things to learn, the separation of what is relevant and what isn’t could be blurry also. There is no such thing as too much knowledge but again focus first on what is directly related with the position you want/have first.

Bearing in mind the above topics now you just need to figure it out what you like to do and start practicing with some project ideas, here are some:

- **Pentest:** ok so you would like to be a penetration tester? Start with the basics, learn how the most common attacks work and try them out in purposely vulnerable systems like [Webgoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/), [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/), [Metasploitable](https://information.rapid7.com/download-metasploitable-2017.html), stress those machines as much as possible, when you feel comfortable go for the next level with CTF challenges such as [hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), more complex vulnerable environments like [flaw.cloud](http://flaws.cloud/) for cloud (aws) and [kubegoat](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/kubernetes-goat/setup.html) for kubernetes. At this point you probably will be very capable for a job in the area but if you still want a bigger challenge try creating your own environments and break them using new exploits released or trying to understand how a patch fixed a vulnerability. Disclaimer: hacking live systems/websites/applications is a crime and you could be prosecuted, however some companies do have a bug bounty program, read those through and get all consent/scope before trying anything.
- **Appsec:** do you like coding and application security? This one is very similar to pentest but you will dig deeper in the application side of it, first grab the book [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TTO0O8IO1VWN&dchild=1&keywords=web+application+hackers+handbook&qid=1627352136&sprefix=web+app%2Caps%2C475&sr=8-1) and learn the main attacks and flaws, there are some scenarios in there you can practice too. Same for [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) page and it’s resources. The next project could be finding or coding yourself vulnerable samples and exploit them and then fix it afterwards. If you got really good with that go to the next project, do your best coding and scan your code/app with SAST, DAST and SCA tools, grab the vulnerabilities found and try exploit and fix.
- **Cloud:** is your focus infrastructure, mostly cloud? If so start deploying simple infrastructure on your preferred cloud. Aws has a lot of [labs and workshops](https://workshops.aws/) that you could try and build up as you go, other cloud providers might have similar resources. Learn how to deploy stuff using the native solution, terraform and API. Have a look at guidelines of cloud security such as CIS and CSA, learn how the weakness and misconfiguration occur and try fix those (be careful deploying vulnerable stuff on cloud providers). All cloud providers have a free tier where you can try out most services for free.
- **Blue team:** is your focus on defence rather than attack? If you want to exercise the defensive capabilities you can recreate any of the above projects but when exploiting try add tools to log and detect such as IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, telemetry and SRE tooling, send all alerts to a SIEM/SOAR, you can find at least of of each tool free from open source projects. If you are playing on cloud environments try setup their native security tooling and auto remediation actions. A bit risky but you could also spin up a honeypot and learn from the attacks coming into it.
- **Malware/Forensics/Reversing:** interested in do malware analysis or reverse engineering? There are heaps of [crackme](https://crackmes.one/) challenges in the web, download all the tools you need and after learn the basics try crack those challenges, you could also try crack old and simple softwares (IP protection laws may apply here, be careful). When felling confident spin up a virtual machine and try an old malware. More on the forensics side you can also find in the internet memory or network dumps to analyse and try solve what happened.
